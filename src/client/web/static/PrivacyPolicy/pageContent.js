          In order for you to create an account on Dare Drop and use our Services, we need to
          collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may
          include:
				</p>
				<ul className={classes.list}>
					<li>
            Information you provide by completing forms on Dare Drop — your name, email and postal
            addresses, telephone number, country of residence, login, and password details. We may
            ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our
            newsletters, upload, pledge or submit content through Dare Drop, or if you contact us;

					<li>
            Information you provide for identity verification purposes when fulfilling a dare,
            including your legal name, business name and Tax ID for business entities, and date of
            birth. In some cases, our payment processor will request that you provide a secure
            upload of an identity document (such as your passport, drivers license or other
            government-issued ID) to Dare Drop;
					</li>
					<li>
            Details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services. Dare Drop
            partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing, and the payment
            information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their privacy
            policies (for Stripe’s, click here). Dare Drop doesn’t store your payment information
            apart from the last four digits of your credit card or bank account (as applicable),
            expiration date, and country, which we require for tax, government regulatory, and
            security purposes;
					</li>
					<li>
            Information about your activity on and interaction with Dare Drop, including use of our
            mobile apps (such as your IP address, the type of device or browser you use, and your
            actions on the Site);
					</li>
					<li>
            Information about the ways people visit and interact with our Site, in the form of
            traffic analytics. You can opt out of being included in Google Analytics{' '}

            or comments, or report a problem); and

          You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this will limit your ability

          providing only an email address. However, to adjust your pledge, save payment details for
          future pledges, make dare comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will

          Data protection law in Europe requires a “lawful basis” for collecting and retaining
          personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful
          bases include:
				</p>
				<ul className={classes.list}>
					<li>
            Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your
            personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable
            creators to establish and display their dares, and enable backers to find and make
            pledges to them.
					</li>
					<li>
            Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For
            example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our
            Services.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
              Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which
              essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways
              which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue
              our legitimate interests n a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running
              our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
						</p>
						<p>
              For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and
              abuse and to keep the Services secure. We may also send you promotional communications
              about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
						</p>
						<p>
              We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements
              of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to
              improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.

            information.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
          If a dare you have backed is successfully funded, the creator will receive the email
          address associated with your Dare Drop account. They may also send you a survey
          requesting information needed to provide any reward. (For instance, they may need your
          mailing address, or T-shirt size.) Any information you provide in such surveys will be
          received by the deliverer.
				</p>
				<p>
          Deliverers are required to keep backer information confidential, except as strictly
          necessary to communicate with backers directly and fulfill rewards. Delverers should not
          ask for personal information that isn’t necessary to provide your reward, and should never
          request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment
          information. Contact us at <a href={`mailto:${EMAIL}`}>{EMAIL}</a> if you receive a request for information
          that seems inappropriate or excessive
				</p>

          Collaborators are third parties that deliverers can appoint to help manage their dare.
          These collaborators may be able to access the information available to deliverers
          (including backers’ names, email addresses, pledge amounts, messages, and survey
          responses), and are required to treat backers’ personal information with the same care and
          respect as deliverers are.
