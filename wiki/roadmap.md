## Step 1: The Bedrock Dataspace Browser

A person uses it to suck in all their data into a private, secure store. Then itâ€™s organized for them into a secure, searchable record.

We are building pipelines to 3rd party apps, a chrome extension, other "data capture" features, and a very basic interface to browse the database and find things.

### Data Pipelines

3rd party apps:

- gmail
- plaid for banking (WIP to migrate away from...)

Passive data capture:

- local folder mirror
- "listener"

Active capture:

- chrome extension
- "Magic Box" -- dump any data in (text, image, url, etc) and it gets parsed, structured, and piped into your DB.

### user interface

- show all data
- browse
- filter, sort, and search
